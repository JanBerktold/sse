	Age int
}

func main() {

	http.HandleFunc("/event", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		// get a SSE connection from the HTTP request
		// in a real world situation, you should look for the error (second return value)
		conn, _ := sse.Upgrade(w, r)

		// writes the struct as JSON
		conn.WriteJson(&Person{
			Name: "Jan",
			Age: 17,
		})

		// writes the struct as XML
		conn.WriteXml(&Person{
			Name: "Ernst",
			Age: 23,
		})

		// write a plain string
		conn.WriteString("Hello how are you?")

		for {
			// keep this goroutine alive to keep the connection

			// get a message from some channel
			// blocks until it recieves a messages and then instantly sends it to the client
			msg := <-someChannel
			conn.WriteString(msg)
		}
